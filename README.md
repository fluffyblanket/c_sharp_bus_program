# c_sharp_bus_program
Final project for my first introduction to C#-course

This is probably a mess but i'm proud as fuck

Assignment: create a console program that lets the user create a bus, fill that bus with passengers and do various things 
Most proud of the way I solved how to let a passanger leave the bus.
